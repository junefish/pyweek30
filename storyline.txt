CASTAWAY!
As a long haul freighter captain on a jorney from the Chara system your freighter crew mutinies
shooting you onto the closest planet in an escape shuttle. You have a limited food supply, very little
shelter and no known way of ever leaving this rock, ever.

stage 1
find the cave. You need shelter, there may be more then one. Different caves may contain usefull
things, some may contain wild animals or dangerous conditions.

stage 2
In the light of the second sun there seams to be a glimmer off of one of the back walls of a specific
cave, noticed in certain times of the day or if spending the night in the cave. This leads to discovering
a small, previously unknown military base of a species long extinct and unknown until now.

stage 3
navigating the base, maybe a couple of levels going down, maybe even some aliens still alive? or wild
animals.

stage 4
finding a decent alien spaceship that can get you home, stealing it and getting it into orbit.
