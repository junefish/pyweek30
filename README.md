Regarding the files i added

1. unzip maps and put in same folder as others, its a map represented by .txt
2. saple.py -its sample game using the engine i made today

- i suggest watching it last

3. ray_cast.py

- dont touch it works
- u dont need to read it for now

4. pyweek_engine.py

- READ this file pls I left a ton of comments there
- some additional usefull comments below
- [
- u can edit collisions in collisions class (ignore **init** method thats in the
  class),
- movement is done in collisions(),
- ignore class Ray_cast_block for now,
- dir_movement is movement but saved in another variable(but a little different,
  u can ignore),
- last func load_objects() defines what object each symbol in map represents
- ]

* thats it, after 4 just look at sample.py
